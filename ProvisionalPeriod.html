  <h1 id="overview">The Behind The Wheel Test</h1>
  <h3 class="paragraph"id="you" >Congratulations on earning your driver's license! After you pass all the exams, and you are under 18, you are the owner of a provisional license.  For exactly one year after you pass your behind-the-wheel exam, you must abide by certain driving restrictions. You cannot drive between 11 pm and 5 am. You cannot drive someone under 20 years of age unless a guardian, driving instructor, or licensed driver at least 25 years of age is in the vehicle. <br></br>
If necessary, there are exceptions to this probation period. If you have a medical necessity, school-authorized activities, employment necessity, or an immediate need of a family member the DMV will make an exception. Here are the different methods to qualify for the exception: <br></br>
<ul>
  <li class="list">Medical necessity:</li>
  <li>The note must be signed by your physician
Must include the date of recovery</li> <br></br>
  <li class="list">School or school-authorized activities:</li>
  <li>The note must be signed by your school principal, dean, or designee</li>
  <li>Must include a reason for the school or school-authorized activity</li>
  <li>Must have a probable date when the activity will end</li> <br></br>
<li class="list">Employment necessity:<li>
<li>The note must be signed by your employer,
  Must verify employment</li>
<li>Must include the probable date your employment will end.</li> <br></br>
<li class="list">Immediate need of family member:</li>
<li>The note must be signed by your parent or guardian</li>
<li>Must include the reason</li>
  <li>Must include the probable date the necessity will end</li>
</ul>

Breaking one of the provisional licensing rules can result in points being added to your driving record. If you have a violation point count of two or more within 12 months, you will receive a 30-day restriction. If you have three or more points within 12 months, you will receive a 6-month suspension and 1 year probation. Be a safe driver!
